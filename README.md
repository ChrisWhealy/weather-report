# Weather Report App based on ScalaJS

This weather report app accesses OpenWeatherMap.org to obtain the current weather information for whatever city (or cities) match your input value.

## IMPORTANT!
In order for this app to function, you must register with [OpenWeatherMap.org](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up) in order to obtain your own API Key.  Without this value, this app is not able to retrieve any data from OpenWeatherMap.org.

Once you have your own API key, paste it into the relevant input field on the UI and then you can start using the app.
